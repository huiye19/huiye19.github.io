                <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of technical and empirical Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer Graphics (CG), and Communication & Media Studies, with a focus on content creation and interaction design with emerging technologies such as Generative AI and AR/VR. My work spans various practical and creative applications including 3D sketching, animation creation, game design and development, cultural heritage preservation, and artistic expression. My recent research explores:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Novel interactive techniques, tools, and systems with GenAI and AR/VR</li>
                    <li>How people utilize GenAI and LLMs in domain-specific creative applications  </li>
                    <li>Technology-assisted artistic practice and creative works  </li>
